Convert this static HTML website into a fully working React.js app.

- Use React Router for navigation between tools.
- Each tool in the "tools" folder should become a separate React component.
- Keep all existing functionality working (JS, CSS, etc.).
- The homepage (index.html) should become the main page.
- Handle all required conversions automatically and fix any issues.

I donâ€™t care how you manage the files, I just want it to work properly in React. And also improve the CSS
